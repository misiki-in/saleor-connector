/**
 * Storefront REST paths, intercepted.
 *
 * This connector inherits methods that address the storefront's REST API by path — `/api/orders`,
 * `/api/reviews`, `/api/vendors`, dozens more. Those paths are relative, so in dev a Vite proxy
 * forwards them to that REST API and in production they hit the storefront's own origin. Behind
 * Saleor there is no such API, so the request can only fail.
 *
 * Reads for a collection resolve empty (a store legitimately has none); reads for one record and
 * every write throw, because a blank detail page reads as broken and a silent success would tell a
 * shopper their review or enquiry was saved when nothing left the browser. Each distinct path is
 * reported once, so gaps surface while developing instead of staying invisible.
